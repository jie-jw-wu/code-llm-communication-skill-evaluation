The function `fibfib(n: int) -> int` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer.\n2.

For `n > 2`, a list `fibfib_list` is initialized with the first three elements of the sequence [0, 0, 1].\n4. A loop is used to iterate from 3 to `n` (inclusive) to calculate the remaining elements of the sequence.\n5. At each iteration, the next element is calculated as the sum of the last three elements in `fibfib_list`.\n6. Finally, the `n`-th element is returned as the output.", "original_prompt": "\n\ndef fibfib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:\n    fibfib(0) == 0\n    fibfib(1) == 0\n    fibfib(2) == 1\n    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).\n    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.\n    >>> fibfib(1)\n    0\n    >>> fibfib(5)\n    4\n    >>> fibfib(8)\n    24\n    \"\"\"\n", "modified_prompt": "You are an expert software developer.

It initializes an empty list (`result`) to store the values and then iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if the current `i` is even. If `i` is even, it calculates the factorial of `i` by multiplying the numbers from 1 to `i` and appends the factorial value to the `result` list. If `i` is odd, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` and appends the sum to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list.\n\nFor example, `f(5)` would return `[1, 2, 6, 24, 15]` as expected.", "original_prompt": "\ndef f(n):\n    \"\"\" Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even\n    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\n    i starts from 1.\n    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\n    Example:\n    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n    \"\"\"\n", "modified_prompt": "You are an expert software developer.

The function returns True if it is possible, and False otherwise.\n\nTo determine if the array can be sorted, the function first checks if the array is empty. If it is empty, it immediately returns True since an empty array is considered sorted.\n\nIf the array is not empty, the function creates a sorted version of the array using the `sorted` function. It then iterates through the array and checks if the array is equal to the sorted array. If it is, it returns True.\n\nIf the array is not equal to the sorted array, the function performs a right shift operation by removing the last element of the array and inserting it at the beginning. This process is repeated until either the array is equal to the sorted array or all possible right shift operations have been performed. If the array is equal to the sorted array, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nprint(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # True\nprint(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # False\n```", "original_prompt": "\ndef move_one_ball(arr):\n    \"\"\"We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered.

It calculates the total number of units of water in the grid and divides it by the bucket capacity, rounding up to the nearest integer. This gives us the number of times the buckets need to be lowered in order to empty all the wells. The function returns this number as the output.\n\nIt is important to note that the code imports the `math` module to use the `ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.\n\nThe code also includes three examples with their respective inputs and outputs.

It returns `True` if the date is valid and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function first checks if the date string is not empty. If it is empty, it returns `False` immediately.\n\nThen, it checks if the date is in the format `mm-dd-yyyy` using regular expression matching. If the format is not correct, it returns `False`.\n\nNext, the function extracts the day, month, and year from the date string and checks if the month is valid (between 1 and 12). If the month is not valid, it returns `False`.\n\nThe function then defines a dictionary `days_in_month` that maps each month to the maximum number of days. It takes into account the leap year rule for February (29 days for leap years and 28 days for non-leap years).\n\nFinally, the function checks if the day is valid based on the month and year. If the day is less than 1 or greater than the maximum number of days for that month, it returns `False`.

It first creates an empty list called `even_digits` to store the even digits between `a` and `b`. It then iterates through the range of numbers between the minimum of `a` and `b`, and the maximum of `a` and `b` (inclusive), and checks if each number is even. If a number is even, it is appended to the `even_digits` list. Finally, the function returns the `even_digits` list.\n\nThe code also includes a docstring that provides a description of the function, including details about the input arguments, return value, and examples of how to use it.
