It returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.\n\nThe function first checks if the number is less than 2, as prime numbers are defined as natural numbers greater than 1.

This loop checks if `n` is divisible by any number in the range. If it is divisible by any number, it means `n` is not prime and False is returned.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any divisors, it means `n` is prime and True is returned.\n\nHere are a few examples illustrating the usage of this function:\n\n```python\nis_prime(2)   # Returns: True\nis_prime(4)   # Returns: False\nis_prime(29)  # Returns: True\n```", "original_prompt": "\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.\n    >>> is_prime(6)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(101)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(11)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(13441)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(61)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(4)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(1)\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n", "modified_prompt": "You are an expert software developer.

The function utilizes an internal helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.\n\nThe `prime_fib` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list containing the first 'n' terms of the prime Fibonacci sequence. It starts by initializing the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms (0 and 1). Then, it iteratively generates the next term by adding the last two terms of the sequence and checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` helper function. If the next term is prime, it is added to the prime Fibonacci sequence. The process continues until the length of the prime Fibonacci sequence reaches 'n'.\n\nTo determine if a number is prime, the `is_prime` function checks if the number is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `False` since prime numbers are greater than 1. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any values in that range. If it is divisible, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. If none of the checks result in a division, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.", "original_prompt": "\n\ndef prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\"\n", "modified_prompt": "You are an expert software developer.

The input string is shuffled by splitting it into two halves and then interleaving the characters. Your task is to reverse this process and reconstruct the original string.\n\nFor example, if the input string is \"hsehlullf\", the shuffled string is obtained by splitting it into two halves: \"hseh\" and \"lullf\". Then, the characters are interleaved to obtain the shuffled string: \"hlsluehlf\". The original string is \"hello\".\n\nTo reverse the shuffling process, we need to determine the two halves of the shuffled string and then combine the characters in reverse order.

The grid is a 2D list representing a grid where each cell contains a value representing the fill amount. The capacity indicates the maximum amount that can be filled in each cell.\n\nThe code performs dynamic programming to calculate the maximum fill possible in the grid. It first checks if the capacity is within the valid range (1 to 10 inclusive) and raises a `ValueError` if it is not.\n\nThen, it initializes a 2D array `max_fill` to store the maximum fill values. It then iterates over each cell in the grid and calculates the maximum fill at each cell using the formula:\n\n```\nmax_fill[i][j] = min(capacity, max_fill[i-1][j] + grid[i][j], max_fill[i][j-1] + grid[i][j])\n```\n\nHere, `max_fill[i][j]` represents the maximum fill at the cell `(i, j)`. It is calculated as the minimum value between the current capacity, the maximum fill of the previous adjacent cell in the same row (`max_fill[i-1][j]`), and the maximum fill of the previous adjacent cell in the same column (`max_fill[i][j-1]`). The grid value at the current cell (`grid[i][j]`) is added to each of these to consider the fill amount at the current cell.\n\nFinally, the code returns the maximum fill value at the bottom right corner of the grid, which is `max_fill[rows-1][cols-1]`.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the grid has at least one cell and that all the rows in the grid have the same number of columns.", "original_prompt": "\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a rectangular grid of wells.
