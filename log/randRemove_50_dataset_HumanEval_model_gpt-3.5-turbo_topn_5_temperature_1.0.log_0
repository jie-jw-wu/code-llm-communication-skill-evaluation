The function's purpose is to find the zero of a polynomial function defined by the coefficients in the list.\n\nBelow is the Python3 code for the `poly()` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef poly(xs: list, x: float):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the zero of a polynomial function.\n\n    Args:\n        xs: List of coefficients of the polynomial function.\n        x: Value for which the zero should be found.\n\n    Returns:\n        The zero of the polynomial function at the given value.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the length of the input list is not even.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(xs) % 2 != 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list must have an even number of coefficients.\")\n\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(0, len(xs), 2):\n        result += xs[i] + xs[i+1] * x\n\n    return round(result, 2)\n\n\n# Example usage\nprint(round(poly([1, 2], -0.5), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x - 0.5\nprint(round(poly([-6, 11, -6, 1], 1), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3\n```\n\nThe code above defines the `poly()` function which takes two arguments: `xs` (a list of coefficients) and `x` (the value for which the zero should be found). The function first checks if the length of the input list is even, and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n\nThen, the function iterates over the coefficients in the list, starting from the first index (0) and incrementing by 2 at each step. It accumulates the sum of each coefficient multiplied by `x` (the given value) and the coefficient's corresponding power of `x`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the rounded result.\n\nThe code also includes example usages of the `poly()` function using the provided test cases.", "original_prompt": "import math\n\n\ndef poly(xs: list, x: float):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.\n    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])\n\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list):\n    \"\"\" xs are coefficients of a polynomial.\n    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.\n    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.\n    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients\n    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees\n    a solution.\n    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x\n    -0.5\n    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3\n    1.0\n    \"\"\"\n", "modified_prompt": "You are an expert software developer.

It simulates a car race where `n` cars are driving left to right and another set of `n` cars are driving right to left on an infinitely long straight road. The cars move at the same speed, and the function determines if there will be a collision between any two cars.\n\nThe function creates two lists, `left_cars` and `right_cars`, to represent the cars on the left and right sides of the road respectively. These lists store the indices of the cars.\n\nTwo empty lists, `left_cars_position` and `right_cars_position`, are initialized to store the current positions of the cars. The initial positions are set such that the left cars are at positions [0, 1, 2, ...] and the right cars are at positions [n, n+1, n+2, ...].\n\nThe function then enters a continuous loop where it updates the positions of the cars in each iteration. For each car, the left cars move one unit to the right (`left_cars_position[i] += 1`) and the right cars move one unit to the left (`right_cars_position[i] -= 1`).\n\nAt each iteration, the function checks if there is a collision between any two cars. If the position of a left car equals the position of a right car, it means there is a collision, and the function returns True. If the position of a left car surpasses the position of a right car, it means there won't be any collisions in the future, and the function returns False.\n\nNote: The code assumes that all cars start far from each other and that there are no additional factors affecting the motion of the cars.

It returns `True` if the date is valid, and `False` otherwise. The rules for a valid date are as follows:\n\n1. The date string must not be empty.\n2. The number of days must be within the valid range for the corresponding month.\n\nThe function first checks if the date string is empty. If it is, it immediately returns `False`. Then, it splits the date string into year, month, and day components by using the '-' character as the separator. The year, month, and day are converted from strings to integers for easier comparison.\n\nNext, the function validates the year. It checks if the year is a valid 4-digit number by ensuring it is between 1000 and 9999. If not, it returns `False`.\n\nThen, the function validates the month. It checks if the month is a valid number between 1 and 12. If not, it returns `False`.\n\nFinally, the function validates the day based on the month. For months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), the day must be between 1 and 30. For February, it checks if it's a leap year by verifying if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400. If it's a leap year, the day must be between 1 and 29; otherwise, it must be between 1 and 28. For the remaining months with 31 days, the day must be between 1 and 31.\n\nIf all the validations pass, the function returns `True`, indicating that the date is valid.", "original_prompt": "\ndef valid_date(date):\n    \"\"\"You have to write a function which validates a given date string and\n    returns True if the date is valid otherwise False.\n    The date is valid if all of the following rules are satisfied:\n    1.

To solve this, we define a recursive function `find_min_path` that takes the current state of the grid, the current path, the current position `(i, j)`, and the value `k`. \n\nThe function follows a depth-first search approach to explore all possible paths in the grid. At each step, it checks if moving right or down results in a lexicographically smaller path based on the value at index `k`. If moving right gives a lexicographically smaller path, the function continues the search by moving to the right cell. If moving down gives a lexicographically smaller path, the function continues the search by moving to the down cell. \n\nThe base cases for the recursion are:\n- If we reach the bottom-right cell, we return the current path as it represents a valid path.\n- If we reach the bottom row, we can only move right, so the function calls itself recursively with updated position and path.\n- If we reach the rightmost column, we can only move down, so the function calls itself recursively with updated position and path.\n\nLastly, we call the `find_min_path` function with the initial values (starting from cell `(0, 0)`) and print the result for the given test cases.", "original_prompt": "\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n    each cell of the grid contains a value.
