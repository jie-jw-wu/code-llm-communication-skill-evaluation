A prime number is a number that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. A composite number has more than two divisors.\n\nHere is a Python3 code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    elif n <= 3:\n        return True\n    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not a prime or composite number. Then it checks if the number is less than or equal to 3, in which case it is a prime number. After that, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3. If it is, then it is a composite number.\n\nFinally, it checks the remaining possible factors by iterating from 5 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, then it is a composite number. If", "answer": "Empty", "question_quality": "1", "code": ""}
