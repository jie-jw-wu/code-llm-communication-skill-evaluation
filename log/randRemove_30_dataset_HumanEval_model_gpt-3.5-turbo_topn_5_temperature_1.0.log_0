The function checks if there are any two numbers in the given list that are closer to each other than the threshold.\n\nTo achieve this, the function iterates over each number in the list and compares it with all subsequent numbers using nested loops. If the absolute difference between two numbers is less than the threshold, the function returns True, indicating that two close numbers are found. If no close numbers are found after comparing all pairs, the function returns False.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nnumbers = [1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0]\nthreshold = 0.3\nprint(has_close_elements(numbers, threshold))  # Output: True\n```\nIn the above example, the list contains two numbers (2.0 and 2.5) that are closer to each other than the threshold (0.3), so the function returns True.", "original_prompt": "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n", "modified_prompt": "You are an expert software developer.

It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of nested parentheses in each group.\n\nThe function starts by defining an empty list called `result` to store the final result. It then splits the input string `paren_string` into individual groups of parentheses using the `split` method and assigns them to the `parentheses` list.\n\nNext, the function iterates over each group in the `parentheses` list. For each group, it initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the number of open parentheses encountered and another variable `nested_parens` to count the number of nested parentheses.\n\nThe nested parentheses are counted by iterating over each character in the group. If an opening parenthesis is encountered, the `count` is incremented by 1. If a closing parenthesis is encountered, the `count` is decremented by 1. When the `count` becomes 0, it means that a nested parenthesis has been completed, so the `nested_parens` counter is incremented.\n\nFinally, the function appends the `nested_parens` value to the `result` list and repeats this process for each group.

The polynomial equation is represented in a string format, where each term is added to the equation using string concatenation.

The modulo operation `% 26` is used to ensure that the shifted position wraps around within the range of lowercase alphabets. Finally, the shifted position is converted back to the corresponding character using the `chr` function and all the characters are joined together to form the encoded string.\n\nThe `decode_shift` function, on the other hand, takes an encoded string `s` as input and returns the original string by shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet.

Within the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current divisor. If it is divisible, it divides `n` by the divisor and updates `n` accordingly. If it is not divisible, the divisor is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `n` which represents the largest prime factor of the original number `n`.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the input number `n` is an even number since the initial comment states that `n` is equal to 2.

It swaps the case of all letters and replaces all vowels with the letter 'G'. The function handles both lowercase and uppercase vowels.\n\nThe function first initializes an empty string `encoded_message` to store the encoded message. It then iterates through each character in the input message. If the character is a letter, it checks if it is a vowel. If it is a vowel, it appends 'G' to the `encoded_message`. Otherwise, it swaps the case of the letter using the `swapcase` method and appends it to `encoded_message`. If the character is not a letter, it simply appends it to `encoded_message` without any modification.\n\nFinally, the function returns the encoded message.

A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check. Example For s = \"abcde\", c = \"ae\", the result should be ('bcd',False) For s = \"abcdef\", c = \"b\" the result should be ('acdef',False) For s = \"abcdedcba\", c = \"ab\", the result should be ('cdedc',True) \"\"\""}
