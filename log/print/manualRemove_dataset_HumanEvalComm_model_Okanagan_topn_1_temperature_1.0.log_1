    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:

              4.0                A+

      return ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
    
      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:

The modified description changed the bucket_capacity expected outputs, so clarifying the value of 1 in the grid is essential to clarify the meaning of the bucket_capacity.

    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'

    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even or odd, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is even or odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even or odd, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is even or odd, the next term is 3 times the previous

    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is an even or odd or prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",

    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".

!!!!!!!PROMPT_EVALUATE_QUESTIONS=The original description of a coding problem is modified so that the requirements become inconsistent, incomplete, or ambiguous. Given the modified description, some clarifying questions were raised to clarify the description. Given the original and modified problem description, evaluate the quality of the clarifying questions. Please provide an integer representing the quality of questions (3: Good questions that recover the modified requirements; 2: Fair questions but they cannot help recover the modified requirements; 1: No questions).
  QUALITY=[your int] 
 Please also provide answers to the clarifying questions to recover the modified requirements in the original problem description compared to the modified one. If there is no clarifying questions at all, return empty answers. 
 ANSWERS=```[your answer]```  
 Please strictly follow the format QUALITY=[the int] and ANSWERS=```[the answer]``` in the response! Surround your answer with markdown! 

 ### Questions:  
 ### Modified Problem Description: Generate Python code directly (Markdown) to solve the coding problem.

    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between

 ### Original Description: You are an expert software developer who writes high quality code. With below information, please either generate Python3 code (Respond directly with code only with markdown), or ask clarifying questions: 

def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []
