!!!!!!!PROMPT_EVALUATE_QUESTIONS=The original description of a coding problem is modified so that the requirements become inconsistent, incomplete, or ambiguous. Given the modified description, some clarifying questions were raised to clarify the description. Given the original and modified problem description, evaluate the quality of the questions. Please provide an integer representing the quality of questions (3: Good questions that recover all missing info. 2: Fair questions that recover some missing info. 1: Bad questions or irrelevant content).
  QUALITY=[your int] 
 Please also provide answers to the questions to recover the missing requirements! Finally, add what's new or different in the original descrpition in your answer, compared with the modified problem description!
 ANSWERS=```[your answer]```  
 Please strictly follow the format QUALITY=[the int] and ANSWERS=```[the answer]``` in the response! Surround your answer with markup!
